# Development Workflow

---

## Core Principles

1. **Plan before code** — figure out what to do before you start
2. **Specs injected, not remembered** — guidelines are injected via hook/skill, not recalled from memory
3. **Persist authorized task evidence** — keep research and decisions in task artifacts; write long-lived documentation only with its own authorization
4. **Incremental development** — one task at a time
5. **Capture durable learnings** — propose reusable knowledge after a task; write specs only with explicit authorization

---

## Trellis System

### Developer Identity

On first use, initialize your identity:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/init_developer.py <your-name>
```

Creates `.trellis/.developer` (gitignored) + `.trellis/workspace/<your-name>/`.

### Spec System

`.trellis/spec/` holds coding guidelines organized by package and layer.

- `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` — entry point with **Pre-Development Checklist** + **Quality Check**. Actual guidelines live in the `.md` files it points to.
- `.trellis/spec/guides/index.md` — cross-package thinking guides.

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages   # list packages / layers
```

**When to consider an authorized spec update**: a new reusable pattern/convention, a bug-fix prevention worth codifying, or a durable technical decision.

### Task System

Every task has its own directory under `.trellis/tasks/{MM-DD-name}/` holding `task.json`, `prd.md`, optional `design.md`, optional `implement.md`, optional `research/`, and context manifests (`implement.jsonl`, `check.jsonl`) for sub-agent-capable platforms.

```bash
# Task lifecycle
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<title>" [--slug <name>] [--parent <dir>]
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <name>          # set active task (session-scoped when available)
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source      # show active task and source
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py finish                # clear active task (triggers after_finish hooks)
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py archive <name>        # move to archive/{year-month}/
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list [--mine] [--status <s>]
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-archive

# Code-spec context (injected into implement/check agents via JSONL).
# `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` are seeded on `task create` for sub-agent-capable
# platforms; the AI curates real spec + research entries during planning when needed.
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context <name> <action> <file> <reason>
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py list-context <name> [action]
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py validate <name>

# Task metadata
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-branch <name> <branch>
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-base-branch <name> <branch>    # PR target
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py set-scope <name> <scope>

# Hierarchy (parent/child)
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>

# PR creation
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create-pr [name] [--dry-run]
```

> Run `python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py --help` to see the authoritative, up-to-date list.

**Current-task mechanism**: `task.py create` creates the task directory and (when session identity is available) auto-sets the per-session active-task pointer so the planning breadcrumb fires immediately. `task.py start` writes the same pointer (idempotent if already set) and flips `task.json.status` from `planning` to `in_progress`. State is stored under `.trellis/.runtime/sessions/`. If no context key is available from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or a platform-native session environment variable, there is no active task and `task.py start` fails with a session identity hint. `task.py finish` deletes the current session file (status unchanged). `task.py archive <task>` writes `status=completed`, moves the directory to `archive/`, and deletes any runtime session files that still point at the archived task.

### Workspace System

Records every AI session for cross-session tracking under `.trellis/workspace/<developer>/`.

- `journal-N.md` — session log. **Max 2000 lines per file**; a new `journal-(N+1).md` is auto-created when exceeded.
- `index.md` — personal index (total sessions, last active).

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/add_session.py --title "Title" --commit "hash" --summary "Summary"
```

### Context Script

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py                            # full session runtime
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages            # available packages + spec layers
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <X.Y>  # detailed guide for a workflow step
```

<!--
  WORKFLOW-STATE BREADCRUMB CONTRACT (read this before editing the tag blocks below)

  The [workflow-state:STATUS] blocks embedded in the ## Phase Index section
  below are the SINGLE source of truth for the per-turn `<workflow-state>`
  breadcrumb that every supported AI platform's UserPromptSubmit hook
  reads. inject-workflow-state.py (Python platforms) and
  inject-workflow-state.js (OpenCode plugin) only parse them — there is no
  fallback dict baked into the scripts after v0.5.0-rc.0.

  STATUS charset: [A-Za-z0-9_-]+. When the hook can't find a tag, it
  degrades to a generic "Refer to workflow.md for current step." line —
  intentionally visible so users notice and fix a broken workflow.md.

  INVARIANT (test/regression.test.ts):
    Every workflow-walkthrough step marked `[required · once]` must have a
    matching enforcement line in its phase's [workflow-state:*] block. The
    breadcrumb is the only per-turn channel; if a mandatory step isn't
    mentioned there, the AI silently skips it (Phase 1 planning gate
    skip and Phase 3.4 commit skip both manifested via this gap).

  TAG ↔ PHASE scoping:
    [workflow-state:no_task]      → no active task; before Phase 1
    [workflow-state:planning]     → all of Phase 1 (status='planning')
    [workflow-state:planning-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 1
    [workflow-state:in_progress]  → Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4
                                    (status stays 'in_progress' from
                                    task.py start until task.py archive)
    [workflow-state:in_progress-inline] → Codex inline variant of Phase 2/3
    [workflow-state:completed]    → currently DEAD: cmd_archive flips
                                    status and moves the dir in the same
                                    call, so the resolver loses the
                                    pointer (block kept for a future
                                    explicit in_progress→completed
                                    transition)

  Editing checklist:
    - When you change a [workflow-state:STATUS] block, also check the
      matching phase's `[required · once]` walkthrough steps for sync
    - Run `trellis update` after editing to push the new bodies to
      downstream user projects (block-level managed replacement)
    - Full runtime contract:
      .trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md
-->

## Phase Index

```
Phase 1: Plan    → classify; create a task only for complex or explicitly Trellis-managed work
Phase 2: Execute → implement only after task status is in_progress
Phase 3: Finish  → record optional durable learning and perform only authorized delivery actions
```

### Request Triage

- Simple conversation, read-only inquiry, and low-risk single-file change: handle directly; do not create a task or request workflow confirmation.
- Create a Trellis task only for complex feature work, complex/repeated bugs, multi-deliverable work, or when the user explicitly requests Trellis. Task-creation consent covers task-directory planning artifacts only.
- A task does not authorize implementation, general documentation/spec writes, commit, push, deployment, or archive. For complex work, request at most one implementation approval after the plan is stable; a current explicit approval satisfies that gate.

### Planning Artifacts

- `prd.md` — requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Do not put technical design or execution checklists here.
- `design.md` — technical design for complex tasks: boundaries, contracts, data flow, tradeoffs, compatibility, rollout / rollback shape.
- `implement.md` — execution plan for complex tasks: ordered checklist, validation commands, review gates, and rollback points.
- `implement.jsonl` / `check.jsonl` — spec and research manifests for sub-agent context. They do not replace `implement.md`.
- Lightweight tasks may be PRD-only. Complex tasks must have `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before `task.py start`.

### Parent / Child Task Trees

Use a parent task when one user request contains several independently verifiable deliverables. The parent task owns the source requirement set, the task map, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review; it normally should not be the implementation target unless it also has direct work.

Use child tasks for deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently. Parent/child structure is not a dependency system: if one child must wait for another, write that ordering in the child `prd.md` / `implement.md` and keep each child's acceptance criteria testable.

Create new children with `task.py create "<title>" --slug <name> --parent <parent-dir>`. Link existing tasks with `task.py add-subtask <parent> <child>`, and unlink mistakes with `task.py remove-subtask <parent> <child>`.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown when there is no active task (before Phase 1) -->

[workflow-state:no_task]
No active task. Handle ordinary explanation, read-only work, and low-risk small changes directly. Create a Trellis task only for complex work or on explicit request; task-directory planning artifacts are then authorized, not implementation or delivery actions. GitHub Issue lifecycle applies only when `task.json.meta.source_kind=github_issue`; never infer it from a title, slug, or natural-language number.
[/workflow-state:no_task]

### Phase 1: Plan
- 1.0 Create task `[required · once]` (only after task-creation consent)
- 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]` (`prd.md`; complex tasks also need `design.md` + `implement.md`)
- 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`
- 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]` — Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Grok, Kimi Code (sub-agent-dispatch platforms only; inline platforms skip)
- 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]` (review gate, then `task.py start`; status → in_progress)
- 1.5 Completion criteria

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown throughout Phase 1 (status='planning') -->

[workflow-state:planning]
Load `trellis-brainstorm`; stay in planning.
条件工程方法：仅在命中 Active Task Routing 的窄条件时加载相应 Matt Skill；路由命中只授权读取方法说明，不增加文件写入、通用文档、Git、远端或交付权限。
Lightweight: `prd.md` can be enough. Complex: finish `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md`; request implementation approval only if it has not already been explicitly given for the stable plan.
For `task.json.meta.source_kind=github_issue` only: read the linked Issue, comments, labels, and available Matt brief as input; record relevant facts in task artifacts. Do not call or depend on Matt `/implement`; ordinary tasks skip GitHub entirely.
DESIGN REVIEW GATE (complex only): load `design-review` after the design artifacts are complete. `design-review.md` must exist and `meta.design_review` must be `passed` before `task.py start`; a failed review requires an explicit design revision and a new one-pass review.
Multi-deliverable scope: consider a parent task plus independently verifiable child tasks; dependencies must be written in child artifacts, not implied by tree position.
Sub-agent mode: curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` as spec/research manifests before start.

[/workflow-state:planning-inline]

### Phase 2: Execute
- 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`
- 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress'.
     Scope: all of Phase 2 + Phase 3.2-3.4 (status stays 'in_progress' from
     task.py start until task.py archive; only archive flips it). The body
     therefore must cover every required step from implementation through
     any explicitly authorized delivery action. -->

Sub-agent dispatch protocol applies to all platforms and all sub-agents, including native Codex `SubagentStart` context injection with child-side pull fallback, class-2 Gemini/Qoder/Copilot/Reasonix/Trae/Grok/Kimi Code, hook-backed ZCode/Snow, and `trellis-research`: every dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from task.py current>` before role-specific instructions. On Grok Build, use `spawn_subagent` with `subagent_type` set to the Trellis agent name (e.g. `trellis-implement`). On Kimi Code, dispatch the built-in `coder` / `explore` sub-agent with the matching `.kimi-code/skills/trellis-<role>/SKILL.md` instructions.

[workflow-state:in_progress]
Tools: `trellis-implement` / `trellis-research` are sub-agent types only (Task/Agent tool, NOT Skill; there is no skill by these names). `trellis-update-spec` is the only Skill that may write long-lived specs. `trellis-check` Agent owns the full verification; its Skill is an inline-platform fallback.
条件工程方法：仅在命中 Active Task Routing 的窄条件时加载相应 Matt Skill；路由命中只授权读取方法说明，不增加文件写入、通用文档、Git、远端或交付权限。
Flow: focused implementation verification -> `trellis-check` full verification -> optional `trellis-update-spec` -> explicitly authorized delivery actions.
For `task.json.meta.source_kind=github_issue` only: a local commit may use `Refs #<n>` but does not authorize or prove push, PR, comment, label change, or close. Each explicitly authorized remote write must be followed by a read-back; close only after the remote default branch contains the change, acceptance is complete or explicitly accepted, and close is explicitly authorized.
Main-session default: dispatch implement/check sub-agents. Sub-agent self-exemption: if already running as `trellis-implement`, do NOT spawn another `trellis-implement` or `trellis-check`; if already running as `trellis-check`, do NOT spawn another `trellis-check` or `trellis-implement`. Dispatch is main session only.
Dispatch prompt starts with `Active task: <task path from task.py current>`. Read context: jsonl entries -> `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`.
[/workflow-state:in_progress]

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='in_progress' when
     codex.dispatch_mode=inline. Codex-only opt-in alternate to
     [workflow-state:in_progress]. The main session edits code directly
     instead of dispatching sub-agents. -->

[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]
Flow: `trellis-before-dev` -> edit -> focused verification -> `trellis-check` fallback full verification -> optional `trellis-update-spec` -> explicitly authorized delivery actions.

Do not dispatch implement/check sub-agents in inline mode.
Read context: `prd.md` -> `design.md if present` -> `implement.md if present`, plus relevant spec/research loaded by skills.
[/workflow-state:in_progress-inline]

### Phase 3: Finish
- 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`
- 3.3 Spec update `[on demand]`
- 3.4 Commit changes `[on demand]`
- 3.5 Wrap-up reminder `[on demand]`

> Note: step 3.1 was folded into 2.2 (the single full verification pass). Numbering is kept stable to avoid breaking external references.

<!-- Per-turn breadcrumb: shown while status='completed'.
     Currently DEAD in normal flow: cmd_archive writes status='completed' in
     the same call that moves the task dir to archive/, so the active-task
     resolver loses the pointer and the hook never fires on archived tasks.
     Block preserved for a future status-transition redesign (e.g. an
     explicit in_progress→completed command). Edit through the same spec
     channel as the live blocks. -->

[workflow-state:completed]
Verification is complete. Commit, archive, and session recording remain separate, explicitly authorized actions.
[/workflow-state:completed]

### Rules

1. Identify which Phase you're in, then continue from the next step there
2. Run steps in order inside each Phase; `[required]` steps can't be skipped
3. Phases can roll back (e.g., Execute reveals a prd defect → return to Plan to fix, then re-enter Execute)
4. Steps tagged `[once]` are skipped if the output already exists; don't re-run
5. Artifact presence informs the next step; missing `design.md` / `implement.md` is valid for lightweight tasks and incomplete planning for complex tasks.

### Active Task Routing

When a user request matches one of these intents inside an active task, route first, then load the detailed phase step if needed.

### Guardrails

- Task creation approval is not implementation approval; implementation waits for `task.py start` after artifact review.
- PRD-only is valid for lightweight tasks; complex tasks need `design.md` + `implement.md`.
- Complex tasks must pass the one-pass `design-review` gate (`design-review.md` exists and `meta.design_review == "passed"`) before `task.py start`.
- Planning must be persisted to task artifacts; checks must run before reporting completion.

### Loading Step Detail

At each step, run this to fetch detailed guidance:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step <step>
# e.g. python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase --step 1.1
```

---

## Phase 1: Plan

Goal: create planning artifacts only when the request is complex or explicitly Trellis-managed, then make the implementation boundary clear.

#### 1.0 Create task `[required · once]`

Create the task directory only for complex work or after explicit Trellis/task consent. The command sets status to `planning`, writes `task.json`, creates a default `prd.md`, and auto-targets the new task when session identity is available. This consent covers only files under that task directory:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py create "<task title>" --slug <name>
```

`--slug` is the human-readable name only. Do **not** include the `MM-DD-` date prefix; `task.py create` adds that prefix automatically.

For task trees, create the parent task first and then create each child with `--parent <parent-dir>`. Do not start the parent just because children exist; start the child that owns the next independently verifiable deliverable.

After this command succeeds, the per-turn breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:planning]`, telling the AI to stay in planning.

Run only `create` here — do not also run `start`. `start` flips status to `in_progress`, which switches the breadcrumb to the implementation phase before planning artifacts are reviewed. Save `start` for step 1.4.

Skip when `python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` already points to a task.

#### 1.1 Requirement exploration `[required · repeatable]`

Load the `trellis-brainstorm` skill and explore requirements interactively with the user per the skill's guidance.

**Conditional GitHub Issue context**: Only when `task.json.meta.source_kind` strictly equals `github_issue`, read the recorded repository, Issue number, and URL. Read the Issue, comments, labels, and available Matt agent brief; preserve relevant findings in task artifacts. Those identity fields are the only local linkage. Default branch, labels, PR state and Issue state must be queried as live remote facts when needed. Do not infer association from text, and do not invoke or depend on Matt `/implement`.

The brainstorm skill will guide you to:
- Ask one question at a time
- Prefer researching over asking the user
- Prefer offering options over open-ended questions
- Update `prd.md` immediately after each user answer
- Split large scopes into a parent task plus child tasks when the deliverables can be verified independently
- Keep `prd.md` focused on requirements and acceptance criteria
- For complex tasks, produce `design.md` and `implement.md` before implementation starts

When considering a parent/child split:
- Use a parent task when one request contains several independently verifiable deliverables.
- Parent tasks own source requirements, child-task mapping, cross-child acceptance criteria, and final integration review.
- Child tasks own actual deliverables that can be planned, implemented, checked, and archived independently.
- Parent/child structure is not a dependency system. If child B depends on child A, write that ordering in child B's `prd.md` / `implement.md`.
- Start the child task that owns the next deliverable. Do not start the parent unless the parent itself has direct implementation work.

Return to this step whenever requirements change and revise the relevant artifact.

#### 1.2 Research `[optional · repeatable]`

Research can happen at any time during requirement exploration. It isn't limited to local code — you can use any available tool (MCP servers, skills, web search, etc.) to look up external information, including third-party library docs, industry practices, API references, etc.

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Spawn the research sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-research`
- **Task description**: Research <specific question>
- **Key requirement**: Research output MUST be persisted to `{TASK_DIR}/research/`

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Do the research in the main session directly and write findings into `{TASK_DIR}/research/`. `codex-inline` is the explicit mode that keeps work in the main session.

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Research artifact conventions**:
- One file per research topic (e.g. `research/auth-library-comparison.md`)
- Record third-party library usage examples, API references, version constraints in files
- Note relevant spec file paths you discovered for later reference

Brainstorm and research can interleave freely — pause to research a technical question, then return to talk with the user.

**Key principle**: Research output must be written to files, not left only in the chat. Conversations get compacted; files don't.

#### 1.3 Configure context `[required · once]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Curate `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` so the Phase 2 sub-agents get the right spec/research context. These files were seeded on `task create` with a single self-describing `_example` line; your job here is to fill in real entries.

**Location**: `{TASK_DIR}/implement.jsonl` and `{TASK_DIR}/check.jsonl` (already exist).

**Format**: one JSON object per line — `{"file": "<path>", "reason": "<why>"}`. Paths are repo-root relative.

**What to put in**:
- **Spec files** — `.trellis/spec/<package>/<layer>/index.md` and any specific guideline files (`error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, etc.) relevant to this task
- **Research files** — `{TASK_DIR}/research/*.md` that the sub-agent will need to consult

**What NOT to put in**:
- Code files (`src/**`, `packages/**/*.ts`, etc.) — those are read by the sub-agent during implementation, not pre-registered here
- Files you're about to modify — same reason

**Split between the two files**:
- `implement.jsonl` → specs + research the implement sub-agent needs to write code correctly
- `check.jsonl` → specs for the check sub-agent (quality guidelines, check conventions, same research if needed)

These manifests do not replace `implement.md`. `implement.md` is the human-readable execution plan for a complex task; jsonl files only list context files to inject or load.

**How to discover relevant specs**:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages
```

Lists every package + its spec layers with paths. Pick the entries that match this task's domain.

**How to append entries**:

Either edit the jsonl file directly in your editor, or use:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" implement "<path>" "<reason>"
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py add-context "$TASK_DIR" check "<path>" "<reason>"
```

Delete the seed `_example` line once real entries exist (optional — it's skipped automatically by consumers).

Ready gate: both `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must contain at least one real `{"file": "...", "reason": "..."}` entry before `task.py start`. The seed `_example` row alone is not ready.

Skip this step only when both files already have real curated entries.

Skip this step. Context is loaded directly by the `trellis-before-dev` skill in Phase 2.

#### 1.4 Activate task `[required · once]`

After the plan is stable and implementation has explicit approval (unless already approved for this plan), flip the task status to `in_progress`:

```bash
python ./.trellis/scripts/task.py start <task-dir>
```

For lightweight tasks, `prd.md` can be enough. For complex tasks, `prd.md`, `design.md`, `implement.md`, and `design-review.md` must exist; `task.json.meta.design_review` must be `passed` before start. On sub-agent-dispatch platforms, `implement.jsonl` and `check.jsonl` must both have real curated entries before start. Runtime consumers tolerate missing or seed-only manifests for compatibility, but that tolerance is not a planning-ready state.

After this command succeeds, the breadcrumb auto-switches to `[workflow-state:in_progress]`, and the rest of Phase 2 / 3 follows.

If `task.py start` errors with a session-identity message (no context key from hook input, `TRELLIS_CONTEXT_ID`, or platform-native session env), follow the hint in the error to set up session identity, then retry.

#### 1.5 Completion criteria

| Condition | Required |
|------|:---:|
| `prd.md` exists | ✅ |
| Implementation has explicit approval for the stable plan, unless already granted | ✅ |
| `task.py start` has been run (status = in_progress) | ✅ |
| `research/` has artifacts (complex tasks) | recommended |
| `design.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |
| `implement.md` exists (complex tasks) | ✅ |
| `design-review.md` exists and `meta.design_review == "passed"` (complex tasks) | ✅ |
| Linked Issue context is read and relevant facts are recorded (`task.json.meta.source_kind == "github_issue"` only) | ✅ |

## Phase 2: Execute

Goal: turn reviewed planning artifacts into code that passes quality checks.

#### 2.1 Implement `[required · repeatable]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, ZCode, Snow, Oh My Pi]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish with targeted verification for changed behavior
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform hook/plugin auto-handles:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- For Codex, `SubagentStart` supplies native context injection; the agent profile keeps child-side loading as the fallback

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, CodeBuddy, Droid, Pi, ZCode, Snow, Oh My Pi]

[Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish with targeted verification for changed behavior
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then explicitly say the spawned agent is already `trellis-implement` and must implement directly without spawning another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The pull-based sub-agent definition auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Resolves the active task with `task.py current --source`, then reads `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and requires the agent to load each referenced spec/research file before coding

[/Gemini, Qoder, Copilot, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[Kiro]

Spawn the implement sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-implement`
- **Task description**: Implement the reviewed task artifacts, consulting materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`; finish with targeted verification for changed behavior
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: Tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-implement` sub-agent and must implement directly, not spawn another `trellis-implement` / `trellis-check`.

The platform prelude auto-handles the context load requirement:
- Reads `implement.jsonl` and injects referenced spec/research files into the agent prompt
- Injects `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present

[/Kiro]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

1. Load the `trellis-before-dev` skill to read project guidelines
2. Read `{TASK_DIR}/prd.md`, then `design.md` if present, then `implement.md` if present
3. Consult materials under `{TASK_DIR}/research/`
4. Implement the code per reviewed artifacts
5. Run the focused checks named by the task or affected layer; leave one full verification pass to Phase 2.2

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

#### 2.2 Quality check `[required · repeatable]`

[Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

Spawn the check sub-agent:

- **Agent type**: `trellis-check`
- **Task description**: Review all task changes against specs and artifacts; run the one full, proportionate verification pass; fix only in-scope mechanical findings and rerun affected checks
- **Dispatch prompt guard**: The prompt MUST start with `Active task: <task path>`, then tell the spawned agent it is already the `trellis-check` sub-agent and must review/fix directly, not spawn another `trellis-check` / `trellis-implement`.

The check agent's job:
- Review code changes against specs
- Review code changes against `prd.md`, `design.md` if present, and `implement.md` if present
- Fix only in-scope mechanical findings it can verify
- Run the full, proportionate validation set once; rerun only checks affected by a fix

[/Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, codex-sub-agent, Kiro, Gemini, Qoder, CodeBuddy, Copilot, Droid, Pi, Oh My Pi, ZCode, Snow, Reasonix, Trae, Grok, Kimi Code]

[codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

Load the `trellis-check` Skill only because this platform has no check Agent, and verify the code per its guidance:
- Spec compliance
- lint / type-check / tests
- Cross-layer consistency (when changes span layers)

If issues are found → fix in scope → rerun only affected checks.

[/codex-inline, Kilo, Antigravity, Devin]

**Verification ownership**: Phase 2.1 runs focused checks. Phase 2.2 owns one complete, proportionate review of all task changes. Do not repeat full validation in later workflow steps unless a fix invalidates a specific check.

#### 2.3 Rollback `[on demand]`

- `check` reveals a prd defect → return to Phase 1, fix `prd.md`, then redo 2.1
- Implementation went wrong → revert code, redo 2.1
- Need more research → research (same as Phase 1.2), write findings into `research/`

---

## Phase 3: Finish

Goal: report quality, propose durable lessons where warranted, and perform only delivery actions the user has authorized.

#### 3.2 Debug retrospective `[on demand]`

If this task involved repeated debugging (the same issue was fixed multiple times), load the `trellis-break-loop` skill to:
- Classify the root cause
- Explain why earlier fixes failed
- Propose prevention

The goal is to produce prevention candidates. `trellis-break-loop` does not write specs or commit; use `trellis-update-spec` only when the user has authorized a durable documentation update.

#### 3.3 Spec update `[on demand]`

When the task produced durable, non-obvious knowledge and the user authorized a spec update, load `trellis-update-spec` and review:
- Newly discovered patterns or conventions
- Pitfalls you hit
- New technical decisions

`trellis-update-spec` is the sole writer for `.trellis/spec/`; if no durable knowledge or no authorization exists, record no speculative update.

#### 3.4 Commit changes `[on demand]`

Run this step only when the user explicitly authorizes a commit. A request to implement, verify, finish, or archive does not imply commit or push authority. Never push unless separately authorized.

When authorized, the AI prepares a batched commit plan that contains only this task's known files. Goal: produce work commits FIRST; bookkeeping follows only when separately authorized.

**Step-by-step**:

1. **Inspect dirty state**:
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   Snapshot every dirty path. If the working tree is clean, skip to 3.5.

2. **Learn commit style** from recent history (so drafted messages blend in):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```
   Note the prefix convention (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:` ...), language (中文/English), and length style.

3. **Classify dirty files into two groups**:
   - **AI-edited this session** — files you wrote/edited via Edit/Write/Bash tool calls in this session. You know what changed and why.
   - **Unrecognized** — dirty files you did NOT touch this session (could be the user's manual edits, leftover WIP from a previous session, or unrelated work). Do NOT silently include these.

4. **Draft a commit plan**. Group AI-edited files into logical commits (1 commit per coherent change unit, not 1 commit per file). Each entry: `<commit message>` + file list. List unrecognized files separately at the bottom.

5. **Present the plan once, ask for one-shot confirmation**. Format:
   ```
   Proposed commits (in order):
     1. <message>
        - <file>
        - <file>
     2. <message>
        - <file>

   Unrecognized dirty files (NOT in any commit — confirm include/exclude):
     - <file>
     - <file>

   Reply 'ok' / '行' to execute. Reply with edits, or '我自己来' / 'manual' to abort.
   ```

6. **On confirmation**: run `git add <files>` + `git commit -m "<msg>"` for each batch in order. Do not amend. Do not push.

7. **On rejection** (user replies "不行" / "我自己来" / "manual" / any pushback on the plan): stop. Do not attempt a second plan. The user will commit by hand; you skip ahead to 3.5 once they confirm.

**Rules**:
- No `git commit --amend`; any authorized work, archive, or journal commits remain separate and include only known task files.
- Never push to remote in this step.
- If the user wants different message wording but accepts the file grouping, edit the message and re-confirm once — but if they reject the grouping, exit to manual mode.
- The batched plan is one prompt; do not prompt per commit.

**Conditional GitHub delivery**: Only for `task.json.meta.source_kind == "github_issue"`, use `Refs #<n>` in a local commit when appropriate and report the SHA as local traceability, not remote delivery. Push, PR creation/update, comments, label changes and close are separate remote actions: obtain explicit authorization for the exact listed actions, perform no unlisted action, and read each remote object back after writing. Before closing, verify the remote default branch contains the change, acceptance is complete or explicitly accepted, and the user has explicitly authorized closing. The detailed contract is `.trellis/spec/guides/github-issue-lifecycle.md`.

#### 3.5 Wrap-up reminder

After the above, report the task state and offer `/finish-work` only when the user wants an explicitly authorized archive or session record. It never commits or archives implicitly.

For `task.json.meta.source_kind == "github_issue"`, report local completion and remote delivery separately. Do not claim the Issue is closed unless the authorized close action has succeeded and its status has been read back; ordinary tasks skip this GitHub-specific report.

## Customizing Trellis (for forks)

This section is for developers who want to modify the Trellis workflow itself. All customization is done by editing this file; the scripts are parsers only.

### Changing what a step means

Edit the corresponding step's walkthrough body in the Phase 1 / 2 / 3 sections above. Critical invariants:
- No active task must triage first; ordinary work proceeds directly, while complex or explicitly Trellis-managed work needs task-creation consent.
- Planning must distinguish lightweight PRD-only tasks from complex tasks that require `prd.md`, `design.md`, and `implement.md` before start.
- Every delivery path must preserve explicit authorization for commit, push, archive, and session recording.

All tag blocks live in the `## Phase Index` section above, immediately after each phase summary:

| Scope | Corresponding tag |
|---|---|
| No active task (before Phase 1) | `[workflow-state:no_task]` (after the Phase Index ASCII art) |
| All of Phase 1 (task created → ready for implementation) | `[workflow-state:planning]` (after Phase 1 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 1 | `[workflow-state:planning-inline]` |
| Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 (implementation + check + wrap-up) | `[workflow-state:in_progress]` (after Phase 2 summary) |
| Codex inline Phase 2 + Phase 3.2–3.4 | `[workflow-state:in_progress-inline]` |
| After Phase 3.5 (archived) | `[workflow-state:completed]` (after Phase 3 summary; **currently DEAD**) |

### Changing the per-turn prompt text

Directly edit the body of the corresponding `[workflow-state:STATUS]` block. After editing, run `trellis update` (if you're a template maintainer) or restart your AI session (if you're customizing your own project) — no script changes required.

### Adding a custom status

Add a new block:

```
[workflow-state:my-status]
your per-turn prompt text
[/workflow-state:my-status]
```

Constraints:
- STATUS charset: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` (underscores and hyphens allowed, e.g. `in-review`, `blocked-by-team`)
- A lifecycle hook must write `task.json.status` to your custom value, otherwise the tag is never read
- Lifecycle hooks live in `task.json.hooks.after_*` and bind to one of `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`

### Adding a lifecycle hook

Add a `hooks` field to your `task.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "after_finish": [
      "your-script-or-command-here"
    ]
  }
}
```

Supported events: `after_create / after_start / after_finish / after_archive`. Note that `after_finish` ≠ a status change (it only clears the active-task pointer); use `after_archive` for "task is done" notifications.

### Full contract

For the workflow state machine's runtime contract, the locations of all status writers, pseudo-statuses (`no_task` / `stale_<source_type>`), the hook reachability matrix, and other deep details, see:

- `.trellis/spec/cli/backend/workflow-state-contract.md` — runtime contract + writer table + test invariants
- `.trellis/scripts/inject-workflow-state.py` — actual parser (reads workflow.md only, no embedded text)
